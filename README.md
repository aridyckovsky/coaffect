# coaffect
Welcome to the Coaffect repo! We're building a quantitative modeling framework to investigate collective affective dynamics. How do groups of participants perceive and express emotion? Do their underlying moods alter outcomes? Can social action be predicted by these behavioral tendencies? We hope to answer these exciting questions and more.

## Installation

Please note: We suggest using a virtual environment to avoid cluttering your personal space.

### Dependencies

Prior to installation of `coaffect`, be sure you are using Python 3.6+, and we suggest at least version 3.6.5. You can see available releases [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, this modeling library is configured for graphical representations visualized by [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/download/), which must be installed on your CPU prior to `coaffect`.

### Cloning from GitHub

To get started, begin by cloning the repo `git clone https://github.com/aridyckovsky/coaffect.git`, or downloading manually if you prefer. In your virtual environment and the `coaffect` directory, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to be sure you've got all the right stuff to run the model!
