# coaffect
Welcome to the Coaffect repo! We're building a quantitative modeling framework to investigate collective affective dynamics. How do groups of participants perceive and express emotion? Do their underlying moods alter outcomes? Can social action be predicted by these behavioral tendencies? We hope to answer these exciting questions and more.

## Installation

We suggest using a virtual environment to avoid cluttering your personal space. To get started, begin by cloning the repo `git clone https://github.com/aridyckovsky/coaffect.git`, or downloading manually if you prefer. In your virtual environment and the `coaffect` directory, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to be sure you've got all the right stuff to run the model!
